# Breast-Cancer-Detection
Breast cancer is the second most common cancer in women after skin cancer. Breast cancer is a disease in which cells in the breast grow out of control. There are different kinds of breast cancer. There are basically 2 types of tumors - Benign Tumor which is harmless & Malignant Tumor which is harmful. In this project, we will predict whether a tumor is "benign" (noncancerous) or "malignant" (cancerous) using information like its radius, texture etc. As our target is categorical, we shall use "Logistic Regression" for prediction.

We shall follow the following steps:

* Download the dataset from Kaggle.
* Inspect & Clean the Dataset
* Split the data in Train-Validation-Test
* Identify Numeric & Target Columns
* Scaling Numeric Columns
* Training the model
* Make Prediction
* Check Accuracy of the model
* Compare with a Dumb Model
* Conclusion.
